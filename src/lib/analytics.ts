/**
 * Analytics wrapper — Umami self-hosted.
 *
 * Loads the Umami tracking script lazily after the app mounts so it
 * doesn't compete with the React bundle for first-paint bandwidth.
 * When the env vars `VITE_UMAMI_URL` + `VITE_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` are
 * unset (local dev, or before the VPS Umami stack is provisioned),
 * the whole module becomes a no-op — no script load, no network
 * requests, no console noise.
 *
 * Pageviews are NOT auto-tracked (`data-auto-track="false"`). Umami's
 * auto-tracker records `location.pathname + search + hash` verbatim,
 * and two of our URL shapes carry secrets:
 *
 *   - Supabase auth uses the implicit flow (see lib/supabase.ts), so
 *     right after a login the URL is `/clans#access_token=<JWT>` — a
 *     JWT that decodes to the user's email, plus a refresh_token.
 *   - Capability links (`/share/:token`, `/join/:token`, …) put a
 *     bearer-equivalent secret in the path.
 *
 * Both were landing in the analytics DB, readable by anyone holding
 * an Umami share link. So we drive pageviews ourselves from the
 * router (see components/AnalyticsTracker.tsx) and push every URL
 * through `sanitizeUrl()` first.
 *
 * Custom events go through `track(name, props)` which calls the
 * `window.umami.track(...)` API exposed by the script. Properties
 * stay lightweight — Umami's free tier indexes them as JSON, but
 * heavy values would blow up the dashboard chart legends.
 *
 * Privacy: Umami doesn't use cookies and doesn't fingerprint, so we
 * don't need a consent banner. No PII (full names, emails, person
 * ids) goes into event properties — track shapes, not identities.
